The Patcher is a tool that allows automatic creation of plugin files for games The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4
according to predefined rules provided by the user or a third party.

Rules are stored in XML files and consist mostly of C# source code that is compiled and executed at run-time.
